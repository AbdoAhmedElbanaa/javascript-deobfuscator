# jsdfe: JavaScript Deobfuscator Full of Excuses
- The purpose of this program is to make obfuscated scripts easier to read and help you understand their behavior, not to try to reproduce the original script in an executable form.
- This program is built on nodejs and babel.
- It is a program designed to run on a PC console, and functioning in a browser is only a byproduct, and execution speed is slow.
- It is a program made for personal use, and error checking and so on are quite lax.
- It executes some code of the target script in a vm (iframe) without considering security.
- It often terminates with an uncaught error.
- Sometimes it goes into an infinite loop and freezes.
- The progress is output to the console of the developer tools.
- Please make sure you understand the above before executing.
